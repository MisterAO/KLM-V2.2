## Training Materials

Auto-generated training documents from AHA moments are stored in:
```
70-Training/agent-training/
```

## Detection Methods

1. **Complexity Analysis** - Code/doc changes above threshold
2. **Keyword Detection** - AHA, insight, breakthrough, lesson learned, eureka
3. **Pattern Recognition** - Solutions to recurring blockers
4. **Semantic Analysis** - Via OpenRouter embeddings

## How to Trigger

AHA moments are automatically detected from:
- Chat session exports (80-Sessions/)
- Git commit messages
- Code changes (significant additions)
- Decision logs
- Manual tagging with #AHA or #insight
