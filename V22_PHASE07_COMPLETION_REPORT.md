## Overview

Phase 7 captures learnings from v2.2 development, generates training materials, and prepares foundation for v3.

## Goals

1. **Extract AHA moments** from development
2. **Generate training materials** for future developers
3. **Document patterns and anti-patterns**
4. **Prepare v3 requirements**

## Key Components

### AHA Moment Capture
- Review Collective Journal
- Extract key insights
- Categorize learnings

### Training Material Generation
- Create onboarding guides
- Document best practices
- Build example scenarios

### v3 Requirements
- Collect feature requests
- Analyze pain points
- Define v3 scope

## Success Criteria

- [ ] 50+ AHA moments documented
- [ ] Complete onboarding guide
- [ ] v3 requirements defined
- [ ] Training materials tested
